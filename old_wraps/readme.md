wrap 5 works properly without grow molecule, the stationary is a different state.
wrap 6 try to consider stationary the same with run and tumble state,use t_immobile. The result is not so like what happened.
wrap.0.0.0.cpp the version can produce psl trail, already speed up, but psl is not able to turn down
wrap.0.0.1.cpp the version before 0.0.0, it create atoms on the grid before simulation. So the speed is quite slow. But it is the verison first with psl that is workable
wrap.1.0.0.cpp the first standard version. although still not perfect. psl can be turn down like other feature. can compute_velocity and record visit_frequency during the process.
